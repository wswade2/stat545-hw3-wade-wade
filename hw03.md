In this assignment, I will be using dplyr and ggplot2 to explore the gapminder dataset.


```r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
```

I have a list of tasks to choose from. I will do at least 3 of them.

<h4>Task 1</h4>
First, let's look at how life expectancy changes on different continents.


```r
class(gapminder$continent)
```

```
## [1] "factor"
```

```r
class(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

It's always good to check the class of the variables you are working with before you get started.


```r
g<-ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=continent, y=lifeExp))
g  + geom_jitter(alpha=.5, aes(color=continent), position=position_jitter(width=.2)) +
  labs(title="Overview of Continents")
```

This is a good graph showing an overview of life expectancies across each continent. But is there more information that we can glean from this dataset to answer our original question?

I would like to know how the average life expectancy for each continent has changed over time.


```r
filter(gapminder, continent=="Africa") %>% 
  arrange(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, year, color=(year))) +
  coord_flip()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_gradient(low="palegreen1", high="darkgreen")+
   theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey'),plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ # Center the title
  labs(title="Africa", x= "Life Expectancy", y= "Year") #These are actually switched because I originally used the coord_flip function
```

![](hw03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

This plot reveals something interesting. There was one entry that yielded a far lower life expectancy in Africa than all of the others. This may correspond to the <b>Rwandan genocide</b> in 1994.

Let's generate comparable graphs for each of the other continents.


```r
filter(gapminder, continent=="Americas") %>% 
  arrange(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, year, color=(year))) +
  coord_flip()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_gradient(low="lightsteelblue1", high="slategrey")+
   theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'snow2'),plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=1))+ #added a border
  labs(title="Americas", x= "Life Expectancy", y= "Year")
```

![](hw03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->
In the Americas, there is a constant, steady increase in life expectancy. This presents real issues to the social security program, which was started in 1935 when the average life expectancy was much lower.


```r
filter(gapminder, continent=="Asia") %>% 
  arrange(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, year, color=(year))) +
  coord_flip()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_gradient(low="deeppink", high="maroon4")+
   theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'snow2'),plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), panel.border = element_rect(colour = "darkred", fill=NA, size=1))+ 
  labs(title="Asia", x= "Life Expectancy", y= "Year")
```

Some of the countries in Asia appear to have had consistently low life expectancies compared to the rest of the continent. After some searching, I found that Cambodia had a civil war in the 1970s.

```r
cam<-filter(gapminder, country=="Cambodia")
knitr::kable(head(cam, format = "pandoc"))
```



country    continent    year   lifeExp       pop   gdpPercap
---------  ----------  -----  --------  --------  ----------
Cambodia   Asia         1952    39.417   4693836    368.4693
Cambodia   Asia         1957    41.366   5322536    434.0383
Cambodia   Asia         1962    43.415   6083619    496.9136
Cambodia   Asia         1967    45.415   6960067    523.4323
Cambodia   Asia         1972    40.317   7450606    421.6240
Cambodia   Asia         1977    31.220   6978607    524.9722
Here we can see a large drop from their 1972 life expecancy to their 1977 life expectancy corresponding to a genocide of between 1.5-3 million people.

On a lighter note, R only offers 4 shades of maroon. Now we know how Maroon 5 got its name!


```r
filter(gapminder, continent=="Europe") %>% 
  arrange(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, year, color=(year))) +
  coord_flip()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_gradient(low="aquamarine", high="aquamarine4")+
  labs(title="Europe", x= "Life Expectancy", y= "Year")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'linen'),plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), panel.border = element_rect(colour = "darkgreen", fill=NA, size=1)) 
```

![](hw03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

It looks like one country in Europe has trailed far behind the others. I wonder which one it is...?


```r
eur<-filter(gapminder, continent=="Europe") %>% 
  arrange(lifeExp)
knitr::kable(head(eur, n=20) %>% arrange(year), format = "pandoc")
```

This wasn't just one country, but several. And it appears to correspond in part to the reign of the <u>Soviet Union.</u>


```r
filter(gapminder, continent=="Oceania") %>% 
  arrange(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, year, color=(year))) +
  coord_flip()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_gradient(low="orange", high="orange4")+
  labs(title="Oceania", x= "Life Expectancy", y= "Year")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'floralwhite'),plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), panel.border = element_rect(colour = "chocolate4", fill=NA, size=1)) 
```

![](hw03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

It's obvious from this graph that there are very few countries from Oceania. Luckily, their life expectancies have been consistently improving.

<h4>Task 2</h4>
Next, I'll compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for various years.

From <a href=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trimmed_mean.asp>Investopedia:</a>
"A trimmed mean is a method of averaging that removes a small designated percentage of the largest and smallest values before calculating the mean. After removing the specified observations, the trimmed mean is found using a standard arithmetic averaging formula. The use of a trimmed mean helps eliminate the influence of data points on the tails that may unfairly affect the traditional mean."




```r
#knitr::kable(head(africa, format = "pandoc"))
#?knitr::kable
```



```r
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```r
#knitr::kable(my_df)
```

<h3>Process</h3>
<li>This homework was more intimidating than the previous homeworks. There was a lot more freedom.</li>
<li> Once I got started, I definitely got carried away with my exploration of the dataset and the plotting options offered by ggplot2</li>
